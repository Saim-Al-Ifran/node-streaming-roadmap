# Node.js Streaming API – 21 Day Roadmap

This repository documents my **21-day journey to mastering Node.js Streaming APIs**.  
Every day I commit **notes + code experiments** based on the roadmap rules:

- ⏱ Minimum 2–3 hours daily
- ❌ No coding = day not counted
- 🔄 Skip days = restart

## 📌 Goals
- Build strong fundamentals in Node.js streams (buffers, readable/writable, backpressure, pipeline, etc.)
- Practice with real code examples daily
- Create a final streaming project by Day 19
- Use this repo as a **personal textbook + portfolio**

## 📂 Structure
- `roadmap.md` → The full 21-day plan
- `dayXX-topic/` → Notes + practice code for each day
- `final-project/` → Real-world streaming system (Day 19)

⭐ **Why this repo exists:** To track progress, enforce discipline, and create a resource I can revisit anytime.
